# MR-ovarian-aging
Ovarian aging, characterized by a decline in both quantity and quality of follicular pool with advanced age, has been of highly concerned recently. Here we conducted a mendelian randomization (MR) combined with clinical validation to identify therapeutic genetic drugs targeting ovarian aging. Cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) data of druggable gene list was extracted as instrument variables. Summary statistics for age at menopause were from two independent studies. We screened out five therapeutic genetic targets after MR and colocalization analysis, including four protective factors and one risk factor. These therapeutic genes were further validated by the experiment on human subjects. After that, single-cell RNA seq and drug database were analyzed to find target cells within the ovary and potential drugs targeting identified genes. Combining genetic prediction with clinical validation, our work provides theoretical basis and promising direction of therapeutic genetic targets for ovarian aging in the future.
